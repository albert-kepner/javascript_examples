bot: Hello, how can I help?

user: In testing with Jest how do I specify initialization that runs once per test case and/or once per test file?

bot: In Jest, you can specify initialization that runs once per test case and/or once per test file using the following methods:

### Initialization that runs once per test case

To run initialization code before each test case, you can use the `beforeEach` function. Similarly, you can clean up after each test case using the `afterEach` function.

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  // Code to run before each test case
});

afterEach(() => {
  // Code to run after each test case
});
```

### Initialization that runs once per test file

To run initialization code once before all test cases in a test file, you can use the `beforeAll` function. Similarly, you can clean up after all test cases have run using the `afterAll` function.

```javascript
beforeAll(() => {
  // Code to run once before all test cases in the file
});

afterAll(() => {
  // Code to run once after all test cases in the file
});
```

### Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use these functions in a Jest test file:

```javascript
describe('My Test Suite', () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
    console.log('Run once before all tests');
    // Initialization code that runs once before all tests
  });

  beforeEach(() => {
    console.log('Run before each test');
    // Initialization code that runs before each test
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    console.log('Run after each test');
    // Cleanup code that runs after each test
  });

  afterAll(() => {
    console.log('Run once after all tests');
    // Cleanup code that runs once after all tests
  });

  test('Test case 1', () => {
    console.log('Running test case 1');
    // Your test code here
  });

  test('Test case 2', () => {
    console.log('Running test case 2');
    // Your test code here
  });
});
```

In this example, the output will be:

```
Run once before all tests
Run before each test
Running test case 1
Run after each test
Run before each test
Running test case 2
Run after each test
Run once after all tests
```

This ensures that the initialization and cleanup code runs at the appropriate times in the testing lifecycle.
