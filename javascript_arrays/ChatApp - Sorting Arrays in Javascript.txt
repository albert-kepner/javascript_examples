bot: Hello Al, how can I help?

user: Please give an example of how to sort a javascript array of objects ordered by one of the object keys.

bot: Certainly! Sorting an array of objects in JavaScript can be done using the `sort` method. Hereâ€™s an example where we have an array of objects, each representing a person, and we want to sort this array by the `age` property:

```javascript
// Example array of objects
const people = [
  { name: 'John', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Jane', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Alice', age: 28 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 22 }
];

// Sorting the array by the 'age' property
people.sort((a, b) => a.age - b.age);

console.log(people);
```

In this example, `people` is an array of objects where each object has `name` and `age` properties. The `sort` method is used with a comparison function `(a, b) => a.age - b.age` to sort the array in ascending order based on the `age` property.

The comparison function works as follows:
- If `a.age` is less than `b.age`, the function returns a negative number, meaning `a` will be sorted before `b`.
- If `a.age` is greater than `b.age`, the function returns a positive number, meaning `a` will be sorted after `b`.
- If `a.age` is equal to `b.age`, the function returns 0, meaning their order relative to each other remains unchanged.

After running the above code, the `people` array will be sorted by age in ascending order:
```javascript
[
  { name: 'Bob', age: 22 },
  { name: 'Jane', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Alice', age: 28 },
  { name: 'John', age: 30 }
]
```

If you want to sort the array in descending order, you can simply reverse the comparison:

```javascript
people.sort((a, b) => b.age - a.age);

console.log(people);
```

This will sort the array with the oldest person first.
